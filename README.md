I envisioned a clock made up of multiple circles that each increase and change in size at different time rates—milliseconds, seconds, minutes, and hours. My goal was to create a visually engaging experience, so I selected a color palette that draws inspiration from the rainbow but uses softer, more soothing tones. This way, the colors are gentle on the eyes while still being vibrant and lively. I wanted the clock to not only tell time but also to be a captivating piece of art that brings a sense of calm and joy.

In Yoko Ono's book Grapefruit, I was particularly inspired by the simplicity of the "pea piece," which encourages you to carry a bag of peas and leave one behind wherever you go. This concept sparked an idea for my own interpretation: whenever you press the mouse on the canvas, a green dot will appear, symbolizing the act of leaving a pea behind. In my piece, the bag of peas is represented by a green rectangle on the canvas, creating a visual connection to Ono’s original work while adding my unique twist. This interaction allows viewers to engage with the concept of presence and absence in a playful and artistic way.
